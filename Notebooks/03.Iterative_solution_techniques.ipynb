    "**Iterative solution techniques** are methods used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems, especially when direct (analytical) solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. In this context, these methods are called **Relaxation Methods**, as they are used for solving systems of equations, including nonlinear systems. These methods work by iteratively refining an initial guess until a satisfactory solution is reached. Before we begin, I'll encourage everyone who will read this to skip the example if your not fond of number as you will see a lot of equations and numbers here for my examples as I want to be thorough (sorry 😅). Below are some key iterative solution techniques:"

    "\n",
    "Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations, particularly large sparse systems. It's a variant of the Gauss-Seidel method, designed to accelerate its convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a system of linear equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Ax = b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix, $x$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of unknowns, and $b$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decompose the matrix $A$ into its diagonal ($D$), lower triangular ($L$), and upper triangular ($U$) components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = D - L - U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Seidel method updates the solution iteratively using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{(k+1)} = (D - L)^{-1}Ux^{(k)} + (D - L)^{-1}b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In component form, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij}x_j^{(k+1)} - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_{ij}x_j^{(k)} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOR method introduces a relaxation parameter $\\omega$ to accelerate convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{(k+1)} = (D - \\omega L)^{-1} \\left[ (1 - \\omega)D + \\omega U \\right] x^{(k)} + \\omega (D - \\omega L)^{-1}b$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If $\\omega = 1$, SOR reduces to the Gauss-Seidel method.\n",
    "-   If $\\omega < 1$, it's called under-relaxation, which can be used to ensure convergence for some systems.\n",
    "-   If $\\omega > 1$, it's called over-relaxation, which aims to accelerate convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of $\\omega$ depends on the properties of the matrix $A$. For certain classes of matrices (e.g., symmetric positive-definite matrices), an optimal $\\omega$ can be determined analytically. For general matrices, it often requires numerical experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence of SOR depends on the choice of $\\omega$ and the properties of the matrix $A$. For SOR to converge, the spectral radius of the iteration matrix must be less than 1.\n",

    "## 6. **Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chebyshev semi-iterative method is an iterative method used to solve linear systems of equations of the form $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. It is a variant of the Richardson method that utilizes Chebyshev polynomials to accelerate convergence. It is particularly effective when the eigenvalues of $A$ are clustered, leading to faster convergence compared to simple iterative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chebyshev semi-iterative method generates a sequence of approximations $x_k$ to the solution $x$ using the following recursive formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{k+1} = \\omega_{k+1} \\left( \\alpha_k (b - Ax_k) + x_k - x_{k-1} \\right) + x_{k-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\omega_{k+1}$ and $\\alpha_k$ are parameters derived from the Chebyshev polynomials and the spectral radius of the iteration matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the iteration can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{k+1} = \\rho_k \\left( \\frac{r_k}{\\sigma} \\right) + (1-\\rho_k)x_{k-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_k = b - Ax_k$ is the residual, $\\sigma = \\frac{\\lambda_{max} + \\lambda_{min}}{2}$, and $\\rho_k$ is computed using Chebyshev polynomials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_1 = 1, \\quad \\rho_2 = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\lambda_{max}^2+\\lambda_{min}^2}, \\quad \\rho_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\rho_k(\\lambda_{max} - \\lambda_{min})^2}{4\\sigma^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda_{min}$ and $\\lambda_{max}$ are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $A$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    * Choose an initial guess $x_0$.\n",
    "    * Choose $x_1$ (often $x_1 = x_0 + \\alpha_0 (b-Ax_0)$).\n",
    "    * Compute $\\lambda_{min}$ and $\\lambda_{max}$ (or estimates).\n",
    "    * Compute $\\sigma = \\frac{\\lambda_{max} + \\lambda_{min}}{2}$.\n",
    "    * Compute $\\rho_1 = 1$ and $\\rho_2 = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\lambda_{max}^2+\\lambda_{min}^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iteration:**\n",
    "    * For $k = 1, 2, \\dots$ until convergence:\n",
    "        * Compute the residual $r_k = b - Ax_k$.\n",
    "        * Compute $x_{k+1} = \\rho_k \\left( \\frac{r_k}{\\sigma} \\right) + (1-\\rho_k)x_{k-1}$.\n",
    "        * Compute $\\rho_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\rho_k(\\lambda_{max} - \\lambda_{min})^2}{4\\sigma^2}}$.\n",
    "        * Check for convergence (e.g., $\\|r_k\\| < \\text{tolerance}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Output:**\n",
    "    * Return the approximate solution $x_{k+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chebyshev semi-iterative method converges if $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. The convergence rate depends on the condition number of $A$, defined as $\\kappa(A) = \\frac{\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_{min}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence rate is roughly proportional to $\\sqrt{\\kappa(A)}$, which is better than the linear convergence rate of simple iterative methods like the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence is guaranteed if the eigenvalues of $A$ are real and positive. The method's effectiveness is enhanced when the eigenvalues are clustered, leading to a smaller condition number and faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Faster Convergence:** Compared to basic iterative methods, it often converges much faster, especially for well-conditioned systems.\n",
    "* **Effective for Clustered Eigenvalues:** Performs well when the eigenvalues of $A$ are clustered.\n",
    "* **Predictable Convergence:** The convergence rate can be estimated based on the eigenvalues of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Requires Eigenvalue Estimates:** Requires estimates of the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A$, which can be computationally expensive to obtain.\n",
    "* **Sensitivity to Eigenvalue Estimates:** The convergence rate is sensitive to the accuracy of the eigenvalue estimates. Poor estimates can lead to slow or even divergent behavior.\n",
    "* **Not Applicable to General Matrices:** It is primarily designed for symmetric positive definite matrices; it may not converge for general matrices.\n",
    "* **More Complex Implementation:** The recursive formula is more complex than simple iterative methods.\n"

    "## 7. **Richardson Iteration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Richardson iteration is a basic iterative method used to solve systems of linear equations of the form $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a known matrix, $b$ is a known vector, and $x$ is the unknown vector we aim to find. It refines an initial guess of the solution with each iteration by using the residual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The core formula for the Richardson iteration is:\n",
    "    $$x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\alpha (b - Ax^{(k)})$$\n",
    "    * Where:\n",
    "        * $x^{(k)}$ is the approximation of the solution at the k-th iteration.\n",
    "        * $\\alpha$ is a scalar parameter (the step size or relaxation parameter) that influences convergence.\n",
    "        * $b - Ax^{(k)}$ is the residual vector, representing the error at the k-th iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "    * Choose an initial guess for the solution, $x^{(0)}$.\n",
    "    * Choose a suitable value for the parameter $\\alpha$.\n",
    "    * set k = 0.\n",
    "2.  **Iteration:**\n",
    "    * Calculate the residual: $r^{(k)} = b - Ax^{(k)}$.\n",
    "    * Update the solution: $x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\alpha r^{(k)}$.\n",
    "    * increment k, k = k+1.\n",
    "3.  **Convergence Check:**\n",
    "    * Check if the residual $r^{(k)}$ or the difference between successive solutions ($x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}$) is below a specified tolerance.\n",
    "    * If the convergence criterion is met, stop. Otherwise, return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Convergence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The convergence of the Richardson iteration is highly dependent on the choice of $\\alpha$ and the properties of the matrix A.\n",
    "* For convergence, the eigenvalues of the matrix $(I - \\alpha A)$ must lie within the unit circle.\n",
    "* Finding the optimal $\\alpha$ can be challenging and often requires knowledge of the spectral properties of A.\n",
    "* If the value of alpha is poorly chosen, the method can diverge, or converge very slowly.\n",
    "* The matrix A must be such that the iteration will converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages and Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    * Simplicity: The algorithm is relatively easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "    * Basic foundation: It provides a fundamental understanding of iterative methods for solving linear systems.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    * Convergence sensitivity: The convergence is highly sensitive to the choice of $\\alpha$, making it difficult to use in many practical situations.\n",
    "    * Slow convergence: It can converge very slowly, especially for ill-conditioned matrices.\n",
    "    * Limited applicability: It is not as efficient as other iterative methods, such as conjugate gradient or GMRES, for general linear systems.\n",
    "    * Finding the optimal alpha value can be very difficult.\n"
